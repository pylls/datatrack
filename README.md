# The Data Track
The Data Track is a tool that visualizes data disclosures you have made online.
The different visualizations enable you to better understand what online
services know about you. The Data Track is a *proof-of-concept* and only supports
parsing your location history from Google's
[Takeout](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/privacy) service.

## Usage
1. Download or build the Data Track from source (see below).
2. Start the Data Track by running the `datatrack` executable.
3. A browser window should have opened, if not, browse to
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
4. Either follow the provided instructions to download your own data from Google
or use the provided `takeout example.zip` file.
5. Explore the data disclosures. Once you're done, close the Data Track and all
data created by the Data Track will be destroyed.

## Download
See [releases](https://github.com/marcelfarres/datatrack/releases).

## Privacy and the Data Track
Please note that the Data Track is a tool you run on your own device (Windows 10,
  OS X and Linux x64 are supported) that uses your browser to show its user
  interface (Firefox and Chrome tested). We send no data over the network, and
  only retrieve tiles (images) loaded from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  if you use the map view. We enforce this limitation with a [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy).
  When the Data Track parses your data locally it stores part of the data in an
  encrypted internal database (TODO: the database is a key-value store, and keys
  are currently stored in the clear. We need order-preserving encryption or a
  restructuring of our indexes.). The encryption key is randomly generated each
  time you launch the Data Track and subsequently deleted together with the
  database when you close the Data Track.

## Development
The Data Track is developed by [Computer Science](https://www.kau.se/cs) at
[Karlstad University](https://www.kau.se/). The Data Track is a result from the
EU FP7 research project [A4Cloud](http://www.a4cloud.eu/), grant agreement no.
